# How to add test files

Place in this directory one or more .chm files of your choice, and extract their contents (with 7zip for instance) into a directory with the same name as the chm files.

For instance, if you add a file named `test/samples/TEST.chm`, you should extract its contents to a folder named `test/samples/TEST`
