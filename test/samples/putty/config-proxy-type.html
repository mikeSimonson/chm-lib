<h1><a name="config-proxy-type"></a>4.15.1 Setting the proxy type</h1>
<p>
The &#8216;Proxy type&#8217; radio buttons allow you to configure what type of proxy you want PuTTY to use for its network connections. The default setting is &#8216;None&#8217;; in this mode no proxy is used for any connection.
</p>
<ul><li>
Selecting <a name="i0"></a>&#8216;HTTP&#8217; allows you to proxy your connections through a web server supporting the HTTP <code>CONNECT</code> command, as documented in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2817.txt">RFC 2817</a>.
</li>
<li>
Selecting &#8216;SOCKS 4&#8217; or &#8216;SOCKS 5&#8217; allows you to proxy your connections through a <a name="i1"></a>SOCKS server.
</li>
<li>
Many firewalls implement a less formal type of proxy in which a user can make a Telnet connection directly to the firewall machine and enter a command such as <code>connect myhost.com 22</code> to connect through to an external host. Selecting <a name="i2"></a>&#8216;Telnet&#8217; allows you to tell PuTTY to use this type of proxy.
</li>
<li>
Selecting <a name="i3"></a>&#8216;Local&#8217; allows you to specify an arbitrary command on the local machine to act as a proxy. When the session is started, instead of creating a TCP connection, PuTTY runs the command (specified in <a href="config-proxy-command.html#config-proxy-command">section 4.15.5</a>), and uses its standard input and output streams.
<p>
This could be used, for instance, to talk to some kind of network proxy that PuTTY does not natively support; or you could tunnel a connection over something other than TCP/IP entirely.
</p>
<p>
If you want your local proxy command to make a secondary SSH connection to a proxy host and then tunnel the primary connection over that, you might well want the <code>-nc</code> command-line option in Plink. See <a href="using-cmdline-ncmode.html#using-cmdline-ncmode">section 3.8.3.14</a> for more information.
