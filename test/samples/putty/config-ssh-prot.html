<h1><a name="config-ssh-prot"></a>4.18.4 &#8216;Preferred <a name="i0"></a>SSH protocol version&#8217;</h1>
<p>
This allows you to select whether you would prefer to use <a name="i1"></a>SSH protocol version 1 or <a name="i2"></a>version 2, and whether to permit falling back to the other version.
</p>
<p>
With the settings &#8216;1&#8217; and &#8216;2&#8217;, PuTTY will attempt to use protocol 1 if the server you connect to does not offer protocol 2, and vice versa.
</p>
<p>
If you select &#8216;1 only&#8217; or &#8216;2 only&#8217; here, PuTTY will only connect if the server you connect to offers the SSH protocol version you have specified.
</p>
<p>
You should normally leave this at the default, &#8216;2 only&#8217;. The older SSH-1 protocol is no longer developed, has many known cryptographic weaknesses, and is generally not considered to be secure. If you permit use of SSH-1 by selecting &#8216;2&#8217; instead of &#8216;2 only&#8217;, an active attacker can force downgrade to SSH-1 even if the server you're connecting to supports SSH-2.
</p>
<p>
PuTTY's protocol 1 implementation is provided mainly for compatibility, and is no longer being enhanced.
