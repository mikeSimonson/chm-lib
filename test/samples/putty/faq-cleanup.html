<p>
PuTTY will leave some Registry entries, and a random seed file, on the PC (see <a href="faq-settings.html#faq-settings">question A.5.2</a>). If you are using PuTTY on a public PC, or somebody else's PC, you might want to clean these up when you leave. You can do that automatically, by running the command <code>putty -cleanup</code>. (Note that this only removes settings for the currently logged-in user on <a name="i1"></a>multi-user systems.)
</p>
<p>
If PuTTY was installed from the installer package, it will also appear in &#8216;Add/Remove Programs&#8217;. Older versions of the uninstaller do not remove the above-mentioned registry entries and file.
