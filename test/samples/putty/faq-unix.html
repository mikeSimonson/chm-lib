<h1><a name="faq-unix"></a>A.3.2 <a name="i0"></a>Is there a port to Unix?</h1>
<p>
As of 0.54, there are Unix ports of most of the traditional PuTTY tools, and also one entirely new application.
</p>
<p>
If you look at the source release, you should find a <code>unix</code> subdirectory. There are a couple of ways of building it, including the usual <code>configure</code>/<code>make</code>; see the file <code>README</code> in the source distribution. This should build you Unix ports of Plink, PuTTY itself, PuTTYgen, PSCP, PSFTP, and also <a name="i1"></a><code>pterm</code> - an <code>xterm</code>-type program which supports the same terminal emulation as PuTTY. We do not yet have a Unix port of Pageant.
</p>
<p>
If you don't have <a name="i2"></a>Gtk, you should still be able to build the command-line tools.
</p>
<p>
Note that Unix PuTTY has mostly only been tested on Linux so far; portability problems such as BSD-style ptys or different header file requirements are expected.
