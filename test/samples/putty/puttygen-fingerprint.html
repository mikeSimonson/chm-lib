<h1><a name="puttygen-fingerprint"></a>8.2.5 The &#8216;<a name="i0"></a>Key fingerprint&#8217; box</h1>
<p>
The &#8216;Key fingerprint&#8217; box shows you a fingerprint value for the generated key. This is derived cryptographically from the <em>public</em> key value, so it doesn't need to be kept secret.
</p>
<p>
The fingerprint value is intended to be cryptographically secure, in the sense that it is computationally infeasible for someone to invent a second key with the same fingerprint, or to find a key with a particular fingerprint. So some utilities, such as the Pageant key list box (see <a href="pageant-mainwin-keylist.html#pageant-mainwin-keylist">section 9.2.1</a>) and the Unix <code>ssh-add</code> utility, will list key fingerprints rather than the whole public key.
