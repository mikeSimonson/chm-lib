<h1><a name="errors-cant-load-key"></a>10.7 &#8216;Unable to use this private key file&#8217;, &#8216;Couldn't load private key&#8217;, &#8216;Key is of wrong type&#8217;</h1>
<p>
Various forms of this error are printed in the PuTTY window, or written to the PuTTY Event Log (see <a href="using-eventlog.html#using-eventlog">section 3.1.3.1</a>) when trying public-key authentication, or given by Pageant when trying to load a private key.
</p>
<p>
If you see one of these messages, it often indicates that you've tried to load a key of an inappropriate type into PuTTY, Plink, PSCP, PSFTP, or Pageant.
</p>
<p>
You may have specified a key that's inappropriate for the connection you're making. The SSH-1 and SSH-2 protocols require different private key formats, and a SSH-1 key can't be used for a SSH-2 connection (or vice versa).
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, you may have tried to load an SSH-2 key in a &#8216;foreign&#8217; format (OpenSSH or <code>ssh.com</code>) directly into one of the PuTTY tools, in which case you need to import it into PuTTY's native format (<code>*.PPK</code>) using PuTTYgen - see <a href="puttygen-conversions.html#puttygen-conversions">section 8.2.12</a>.
