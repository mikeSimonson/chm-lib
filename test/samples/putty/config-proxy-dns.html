<h1><a name="config-proxy-dns"></a>4.15.3 <a name="i0"></a><a name="i1"></a>Name resolution when using a proxy</h1>
<p>
If you are using a proxy to access a private network, it can make a difference whether <a name="i2"></a>DNS name resolution is performed by PuTTY itself (on the client machine) or performed by the proxy.
</p>
<p>
The &#8216;Do DNS name lookup at proxy end&#8217; configuration option allows you to control this. If you set it to &#8216;No&#8217;, PuTTY will always do its own DNS, and will always pass an IP address to the proxy. If you set it to &#8216;Yes&#8217;, PuTTY will always pass host names straight to the proxy without trying to look them up first.
</p>
<p>
If you set this option to &#8216;Auto&#8217; (the default), PuTTY will do something it considers appropriate for each type of proxy. Telnet, HTTP, and SOCKS5 proxies will have host names passed straight to them; SOCKS4 proxies will not.
</p>
<p>
Note that if you are doing DNS at the proxy, you should make sure that your proxy exclusion settings (see <a href="config-proxy-exclude.html#config-proxy-exclude">section 4.15.2</a>) do not depend on knowing the IP address of a host. If the name is passed on to the proxy without PuTTY looking it up, it will never know the IP address and cannot check it against your list.
</p>
<p>
The original SOCKS 4 protocol does not support proxy-side DNS. There is a protocol extension (SOCKS 4A) which does support it, but not all SOCKS 4 servers provide this extension. If you enable proxy DNS and your SOCKS 4 server cannot deal with it, this might be why.
