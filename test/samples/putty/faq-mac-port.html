<h1><a name="faq-mac-port"></a>A.3.6 Will there be a port to the <a name="i0"></a>Mac?</h1>
<p>
There are several answers to this question:
</p>
<ul><li>
The Unix/Gtk port is already fully working under Mac OS X as an X11 application.
</li>
<li>
A native (Cocoa) Mac OS X port has been started. It's just about usable, but is of nowhere near release quality yet, and is likely to behave in unexpected ways. Currently it's unlikely to be completed unless someone steps in to help.
</li>
<li>
A separate port to the classic Mac OS (pre-OSX) is also in progress; it too is not ready yet.
</li>
</ul>
