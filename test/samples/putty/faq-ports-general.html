<h1><a name="faq-ports-general"></a>A.3.1 What ports of PuTTY exist?</h1>
<p>
Currently, release versions of PuTTY tools only run on full Win32 systems and Unix. &#8216;<a name="i0"></a>Win32&#8217; includes versions of Windows from Windows 95 onwards (as opposed to the 16-bit Windows 3.1; see <a href="faq-win31.html#faq-win31">question A.3.5</a>), up to and including Windows 7; and we know of no reason why PuTTY should not continue to work on future versions of Windows.
</p>
<p>
The Windows executables we provide are for the 32-bit &#8216;<a name="i1"></a>x86&#8217; processor architecture, but they should work fine on 64-bit processors that are backward-compatible with that architecture. (We used to also provide executables for Windows for the Alpha processor, but stopped after 0.58 due to lack of interest.)
</p>
<p>
In the development code, partial ports to the Mac OSes exist (see <a href="faq-mac-port.html#faq-mac-port">question A.3.6</a>).
</p>
<p>
Currently PuTTY does <em>not</em> run on Windows CE (see <a href="faq-wince.html#faq-wince">question A.3.4</a>).
</p>
<p>
We do not have release-quality ports for any other systems at the present time. If anyone told you we had an EPOC port, or an iPaq port, or any other port of PuTTY, they were mistaken. We don't.
</p>
<p>
There are some third-party ports to various platforms, mentioned on the <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/links.html">Links page of our website</a>.
