<h1><a name="faq-iphone"></a>A.3.8 Will there be a port to the iPhone?</h1>
<p>
We have no plans to write such a port ourselves; none of us has an iPhone, and developing and publishing applications for it looks awkward and expensive. Such a port would probably depend upon the stalled Mac OS X port (see <a href="faq-mac-port.html#faq-mac-port">question A.3.6</a>).
</p>
<p>
However, there is a third-party SSH client for the iPhone and iPod&nbsp;Touch called <a href="http://www.instantcocoa.com/products/pTerm/">pTerm</a>, which is apparently based on PuTTY. (This is nothing to do with our similarly-named <code>pterm</code>, which is a standalone terminal emulator for Unix systems; see <a href="faq-unix.html#faq-unix">question A.3.2</a>.)
