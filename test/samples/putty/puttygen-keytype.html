<h1><a name="puttygen-keytype"></a>8.2.2 Selecting the type of key</h1>
<p>
Before generating a key pair using PuTTYgen, you need to select which type of key you need. PuTTYgen currently supports three types of key:
</p>
<ul><li>
An <a name="i0"></a>RSA key for use with the SSH-1 protocol.
</li>
<li>
An RSA key for use with the SSH-2 protocol.
</li>
<li>
A <a name="i1"></a>DSA key for use with the SSH-2 protocol.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The SSH-1 protocol only supports RSA keys; if you will be connecting using the SSH-1 protocol, you must select the first key type or your key will be completely useless.
</p>
<p>
The SSH-2 protocol supports more than one key type. The two types supported by PuTTY are RSA and DSA.
</p>
<p>
The PuTTY developers <em>strongly</em> recommend you use RSA. <a name="i2"></a><a name="i3"></a>DSA has an intrinsic weakness which makes it very easy to create a signature which contains enough information to give away the <em>private</em> key! This would allow an attacker to pretend to be you for any number of future sessions. PuTTY's implementation has taken very careful precautions to avoid this weakness, but we cannot be 100% certain we have managed it, and if you have the choice we strongly recommend using RSA keys instead.
</p>
<p>
If you really need to connect to an SSH server which only supports DSA, then you probably have no choice but to use DSA. If you do use DSA, we recommend you do not use the same key to authenticate with more than one server.
